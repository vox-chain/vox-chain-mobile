# Mobile App

This is a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) app that uses [Expo](https://expo.dev/).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)** - JavaScript runtime
2. **Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)** - Fast, disk space efficient package manager
3. **Install dependencies** - Run `pnpm install` in the root of this monorepo.

Since this app uses [expo-dev-client](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/), you will need to create a development build of the app. To do this, you will need to have android-studio or bare android-sdk installed on your machine (for android) or xcode installed on your machine (for ios and only using a macOS machine).

Alternatively, you can use the [EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/) service to build the app for you on the cloud without needing to install any of the above.

4. **create and run dev app** - For android, run `pnpm android` and for ios, run `pnpm ios`.
